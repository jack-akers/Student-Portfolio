My student portfolio is a glimpse into who I am as both a person and aspiring software developer. The css is filled with some of my favorite colors, a bold and *audacious* font, as well as a photo of me in my natural habitat and a background of my favorite thing. 
There is also functional navigation links at the top of the page, and the preview buttons for my past work are functioning links.
